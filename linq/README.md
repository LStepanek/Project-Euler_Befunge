[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) with [Befunge 93](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Befunge)
===========================================================

These are my test programs in C#

For every problem I have either made a C# solution before the befunge solution *(to test the algorithm)*
or afterwards *(just for fun)*.

Open these programs with [LINQPad 5](https://www.linqpad.net/) or newer
