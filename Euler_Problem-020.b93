[0,3] current multiplicand
[1,3] carry
[2,3] multiplication index
[3,3] sum index


---------------------------------------

The approach is similar to problem 16 - the main task was implementing a long multiplication algorithm in Befunge. 
Then, after 100! is calculated we only need to sum the individual digits.
