Notes
-----

 - For some of the longer programs (err ... like ... all of them) use [BefunExec](https://github.com/Mikescher/BefunGen) or a similar fast interpreter.
 - I restricted myself to the Befunge-93 instruction set, but some programs doesn't fit in the 80x25 size restriction - so I think they are *technically* Befunge-98 programs
